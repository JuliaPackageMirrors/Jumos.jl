Welcome to Jumos's documentation!
=================================

`Jumos` is a package for molecular simulations using the
`Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_ language. Its goal is to be as flexible as
possible, and to make it easy to use and develop novel algorithm for each part
of a simulation. Potential, long range interactions, pair lists computing,
outputs, `etc.` everything can be customisedÂ !

This package is a WIP (Work In Progress), and is not usable for now.

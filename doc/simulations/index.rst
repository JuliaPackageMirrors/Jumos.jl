Simulations
===========

The simulation module is were all the simulation code falls in. This module allow
you to define and run molecular dynamic simulations. The :ref:`simulation-steps`
section describe how the code is organised, and is worth reading to understand
the design of this module. The :ref:`simulation-usage` section show how to use
``Jumos`` to run a simple Lennard-Jones fluid simulation, and is an example of
the API usage.

The others sections describe the existing algorithms and potentials, and explain
how to expand Jumos with your own algorithms or potentials.
